Other chemical cleaning products may contain ingredients from non-renewable sources and have toxic impacts that can hurt the world’s eco-system.

      According to the Environmental Protection Agency, side effects of chemical cleaning products can include headaches, eye, nose and throat irritation, and asthma. In fact, a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine found that, depending upon the use, using harsh chemicals to clean your home regularly can be as harmful to your lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes per day.` },

Children and household pets are more vulnerable to harsh chemicals found in typical cleaners due to their smaller size. With pets and children being closer to the ground and on level with the surfaces being cleaned, it is always best to be sure that you are using non-toxic green cleaning products, especially if they are prone to eating treats off the floor or off direct surfaces.` },

       In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it's easy to overlook the importance of having a clean, organized living space. But what may seem like a mundane chore can have a profound positive impact on our mental well-being, according to research reported in the Journal of Environmental Psychology.

          <p>
           If you’ve given any thought to how your home affects your mental health, you’ve likely recognized that the messier or more cluttered your home is, the harder it is to feel content and fully relaxed. You might even be overstimulated, anxious, irritated, or have a sense of being overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>A clean house provides a host of mental health benefits:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li><b>1. Less stress</b></li>
            <p> One of the most significant mental health benefits of a clean home is stress reduction. When your living space is clean and organized, the environment can give you a sense of control and tranquility.</p>
            <li><b>2. Enhanced productivity</b></li>
            <p> When you're not constantly distracted by the jumbled chaos of a disorganized space, you can better focus on your tasks. This resulting boost in productivity can lead to a sense of accomplishment and reduce feelings of frustration and can also reduce procrastination.</p>
            <li><b>3. Improved mood</b></li>
            <p> It's much easier to feel happy and content in a space that's neat, tidy, and welcoming. That’s because you’re not thinking about all the cleaning you should do or feeling irritated about the mess.</p>
            <li><b>4. Better sleep</b></li>
            <p> When your bedroom is clutter-free and fresh, you're more likely to enjoy restorative sleep. The mental health benefits of restful sleep include improved mood, a greater ability to focus, and a better-regulated response to stress.</p>

        Cold and flu season is never far from the minds of parents of school-aged children. Kids are prone to frequent illnesses for various reasons, including immature immune systems and exposure to germs – often at school or daycare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Illness is often most prevalent when kids return to school in the fall, during cold and flu season, and after holiday breaks. Germs picked up by one school-aged child can quickly spread throughout a household. Teaching children about germs and taking preventative measures at home can help to stop or slow the spread of illness.
