        title: "Safer for the Environment", content: `Green cleaning products are naturally derived, non-toxic, and biodegradable, meaning they have less impact on the environment. Other chemical cleaning products may contain ingredients from non-renewable sources and have toxic impacts that can hurt the world’s eco-system.
        The Clean Water Action’s Green Cleaning Guide recommends looking for items that are: non-toxic, biodegradable, phosphate free, packaged in bulk, natural fragrance, and contains no dyes, chlorine, and hypochlorite.` },

        title: "Safer for You and Your Family’s Health", content: `When you use green products in the home, you can feel safe and comfortable knowing that your family is not breathing in harsh chemicals or having them on or near your skin.

      According to the Environmental Protection Agency, side effects of chemical cleaning products can include headaches, eye, nose and throat irritation, and asthma. In fact, a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine found that, depending upon the use, using harsh chemicals to clean your home regularly can be as harmful to your lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes per day.` },
      { title: "Safer for the Little Ones", content: `In addition to the benefits listed above, green products are even more important for your children and four legged friends! Children and household pets are more vulnerable to harsh chemicals found in typical cleaners due to their smaller size. With pets and children being closer to the ground and on level with the surfaces being cleaned, it is always best to be sure that you are using non-toxic green cleaning products, especially if they are prone to eating treats off the floor or off direct surfaces.` },
      { title: "Better Air Quality", content: `Not many of us like the harsh smell that cleaning chemicals and strong fragrances can leave behind. When you use green cleaning products, you do not have to worry about lingering smells that can have asthma, allergen, or skin side effects.` },
      { title: "Cost Effectiveness", content: `Did you know it is possible to clean your home with items already found in your kitchen?

        title: "How Do Germs Spread in a School?",
        content: `Germs are transmitted via:
• Direct contact (handshakes, hugs)
• Touching contaminated surfaces like doorknobs, desks, or computer mice
• Airborne particles from coughing or sneezing

The spread of cold, flu, viral, or bacterial illnesses is often worsened due to:
• Large class sizes
• Crowded hallways and mingling at lunch
• Lack of proper hygiene habits (handwashing, covering sneezes)
• Highly contagious strains that spread faster than usual`,
      },
      {
        title: "How to Prevent The Spread of Germs at School and at Home",
        content: `According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cleaning frequently touched surfaces is one of the most effective ways to stop germs from spreading.

Here are practical steps families can take at home:

1. **Clean and sanitize surfaces regularly:**  
   Children will inevitably bring germs home. Sanitizing surfaces such as tables, countertops, doorknobs, and light switches helps reduce the spread of illnesses in your household.

2. **Clean school supplies:**  
   Lunch boxes, water bottles, backpacks, binders, and pencil cases can carry germs. Clean them frequently.

3. **Keep up with laundry:**  
   Items like mittens, scarves, blankets, coats, and sweatshirts may hold germs—especially if kids sneeze into their sleeves!

4. **Remove shoes at the door:**  
   Shoes track dirt, dust, and germs inside. Encourage everyone to remove them at the entrance.

5. **Sanitize electronics:**  
   Frequently touched devices such as tablets, smartphones, remotes, and laptops should be cleaned regularly.

6. **Prioritize bathroom cleaning:**  
   Many germs spread through contaminated fluids. Disinfect sinks, toilets, and bathroom surfaces regularly.`,

        title: "Additional Tips for Families",
        content: `• **Encourage proper hygiene:**  
  Students should wash their hands after using the restroom, sneezing, before eating, and immediately after coming home.

• Teach the 20-second rule:  
  Kids should wash hands with soap for 20 seconds (two rounds of “Happy Birthday”).

• Send hand sanitizer: 
  A small sanitizer bottle in their backpack helps maintain hygiene at school.

• **Keep sick children home:**  
  Contagious students should stay home from school, daycare, or extracurricular activities.`,
