        title: "Safer for the Environment", content: `Green cleaning products are naturally derived, non-toxic, and biodegradable, meaning they have less impact on the environment. Other chemical cleaning products may contain ingredients from non-renewable sources and have toxic impacts that can hurt the world’s eco-system.
        The Clean Water Action’s Green Cleaning Guide recommends looking for items that are: non-toxic, biodegradable, phosphate free, packaged in bulk, natural fragrance, and contains no dyes, chlorine, and hypochlorite.` },

        title: "Safer for You and Your Family’s Health", content: `When you use green products in the home, you can feel safe and comfortable knowing that your family is not breathing in harsh chemicals or having them on or near your skin.

      According to the Environmental Protection Agency, side effects of chemical cleaning products can include headaches, eye, nose and throat irritation, and asthma. In fact, a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine found that, depending upon the use, using harsh chemicals to clean your home regularly can be as harmful to your lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes per day.` },
      { title: "Safer for the Little Ones", content: `In addition to the benefits listed above, green products are even more important for your children and four legged friends! Children and household pets are more vulnerable to harsh chemicals found in typical cleaners due to their smaller size. With pets and children being closer to the ground and on level with the surfaces being cleaned, it is always best to be sure that you are using non-toxic green cleaning products, especially if they are prone to eating treats off the floor or off direct surfaces.` },
      { title: "Better Air Quality", content: `Not many of us like the harsh smell that cleaning chemicals and strong fragrances can leave behind. When you use green cleaning products, you do not have to worry about lingering smells that can have asthma, allergen, or skin side effects.` },
      { title: "Cost Effectiveness", content: `Did you know it is possible to clean your home with items already found in your kitchen? Many at-home all-purpose cleaners can be created using everyday products such as rubbing alcohol, dish soap, baking soda, and vinegar. And if you would like your DIY cleaner to be slightly scented, add essential oils! Click here for a few of our favorite DIY sprays and sanitizer created with essential oils.` },

      { title: "Use Your Ceiling Fan", content: `While the spring weather is still mild, opt to use your ceiling fan instead of turning on the air conditioning just yet. Switch your fan to rotate counterclockwise so the cool air is being pushed down. If you have not used your fan since the start of winter, make sure you dust your ceiling fan prior to turning on.` },
      { title: "Dust Lightbulbs and other Electronics", content: `Dust keeps powered items from running at top efficiency. Make sure your electronics are unplugged and cool to the touch before dusting. If you want to take it a step further, switch your lightbulbs to energy efficient bulbs such as LEDs or CFLs.` },
